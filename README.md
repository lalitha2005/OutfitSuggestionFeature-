# Outfit Suggestions App

The **Outfit Suggestions App** is a React-based project inspired by my own challenges with fashion. Like many others, I often found myself spending a lot of time and money on clothes but still ending up with outfits that didn’t quite work. I realized I wasn’t alone in this struggle and thought: *What if there was an app where you could just find complete, stylish outfits, all curated to fit a budget?* 

With that idea, I developed this app to provide a solution for anyone who wants a full outfit—including accessories like bags and shoes—without needing a deep sense of fashion. All the guesswork is removed, and users can filter by budget, find looks that work together, and purchase a cohesive outfit easily.

## Purpose and Concept

The Outfit Suggestions App curates complete looks, including clothing, jewelry, bags, and shoes. Instead of spending hours trying to match items individually, users can choose from pre-styled outfits that fit their budget and are inspired by models and influencers.

### Key Features

- **Curated Outfits from Fashion Influencers**: Each outfit is pre-styled, making it easy to visualize a complete look.
- **Budget-Friendly Filtering**: Users can filter outfits by budget (e.g., under $30, $50, $100), ensuring they find complete outfits within their price range.
- **Detailed Outfit View**: Each outfit includes all the essentials for a complete look—tops, bottoms, accessories, and shoes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple dropdown filter for budget and a clear layout make it easy to navigate.

### Motivation

This project grew from my personal experience as someone who doesn’t have a natural sense of fashion. The goal is to simplify shopping and help others avoid the frustration of buying individual items only to realize they don’t work together. With this app, users can trust that every outfit shown is cohesive and ready-to-wear.
